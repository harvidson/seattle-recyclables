# seattle-recyclables
An interactive map to locate recycling and disposal services in Seattle.

Seattle has a number of services that allow residents to properly recycle or dispose of things that aren't accepted by the city's curbside garbage and recycling programs--things like batteries, electronics, pharmaceuticals, paint, mattresses, and textiles. Yet one barrier to using these services is that the information is dispersed across various websites for public and private organizations; navigating this information can be dizzying, and potential users may not even learn that some services exist. Seattle Recyclables uses Google Maps APIs to help users figure out where to take their no-longer-needed stuff.

<!-- The website aims to contribute to broader goals of reducing landfill waste and contamination of recycling streams and salvaging re-purposable materials. It also aims to support the city's curbside programs by reducing the amount of inappropriate materials left for them to remove. -->

primary user: Max is a diligent Seattle resident who cares about recycling enough to set things aside until she figures out what to do with them. She's frustrated by how much time it takes to research various services, their locations, and hours--especially since she doesn't own a car and has to organize periodic trips to drop things off when all the accepting organizations will be open. She needs an easy way to learn what's out there, check on hours, and chart a route.
