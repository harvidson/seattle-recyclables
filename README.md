# Seattle Stuffcycle
An interactive map to locate recycling and disposal services in Seattle.

Seattle has a wealth of services that recycle or dispose of things that aren't accepted by the city's curbside garbage and recycling programs--things like batteries, electronics, mattresses, and worn-out textiles. Only, these services aren't always easy to find. Information about them is dispersed across websites for the city, county, and private organizations, and often without intuitive, interactive maps. To make navigating this information a little less dizzying, Seattle Stuffcycle combines King County data and Google Maps APIs to help residents figure out where to take their no-longer-needed stuff--and how to get there.

Users can select multiple types of materials they'd like to get rid of and see markers for services accepting those materials drop down on the map. By clicking on a marker for a service provider, users can access address, hours, service description and restrictions, as well as an option to see a list of all the materials the provider accepts. Tags above the map color code the markers that are showing; when a user closes a tag, the corresponding markers are removed from the map.

By making it easier to figure out what goes where, Seattle Stuffcycle aims to help get more materials that are either still useful or hazardous out of the landfill.
